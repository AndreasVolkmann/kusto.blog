## Committing multiple bulks of data in a single transaction

At times, you may want to ingest large bulks of data, but make them available to query in a single transaction, only when all bulks have been ingested successfully.

For this purpose, I can suggest the following techniques - one handles the case where you want to emplace (or replace) the contents of an entire table; the other handles the case where you want to do so for a subset of the contents of the table.

### Switching tables by renaming

An example use case could be when you want to ingest an entire table which contains a snapshot of data, and replace the previous snapshot of the data, without affecting the ability to query the table or accessing the previous "version" of the snapshot.

1. Let's assume you want the data to be queryable in a table named `T` (whether or not `T` exists before we begin).
2. You can create a new table, named `T_temp` (for example), which has the same schema as `T`.
    - A simple way to do so is using a [.set command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/data-ingestion/#set-append-set-or-append-set-or-replace):
        ```
        .set T_temp <| T | limit 0
        ```
3. Ingest all your data into `T_temp`.
4. When your ingestion completes successfully, "switch" both tables using the [.rename tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/tables#rename-tables) command:
    ```
    .rename tables T = T_temp, T_temp = T
    ``` 
5. Assuming the data that was originally in `T` is no longer of interest, simply drop the `T_temp` table using the [.drop table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/tables#drop-table) command.
6. Note that throughout your entire ingestion process and after it, the full data set in `T` remains available for queries, and only when you run the [.rename tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/tables#rename-tables) command does the data get switched in a single transaction.

### Tagging and replacing extents (data shards)

Tagging [extents (data shards)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview) can be a useful way to identify and handle bulks of data which share a common characteristic.

Ane example use case could be when you want to replace a subset of the data in your table (e.g. all the data from a specific day or week), without affecting the ability to query the table, or accessing the previous "version" of the data. 

1. Let's assume your table name it `T`.
2. You can create a new table, `T_temp` as shown in the previous section. This table will have the same schema as `T`.
3. Ingest all your data into `T_temp`, and specify unique [drop-by](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview#drop-by-extent-tags) tags when ingesting this data (so that in the future, you'll be able to identify and replace it, according to this tag).
    - Multiple ingestion methods allow you to the `tags` [ingestion property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/data-ingestion/#ingestion-properties).
    - For this example, let's use `drop-by:2018-10-26` as our tag.
4. When all ingestion completes successfully, use the [.replace extents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-commands#replace-extents) command to:
    1. Drop all [extents (data shards)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview) with the relevant [drop-by](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview#drop-by-extent-tags) tags from `T`.
    2. Move all [extents (data shards)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview) with the relevant [drop-by](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview#drop-by-extent-tags) tags from `T_temp` to `T`.
    - Here's how the command would look like:
        ```
        .replace extents in table T <| 
        { .show table T extents where tags has 'drop-by:2018-10-26' },
        { .show table T_Temp extents where tags has 'drop-by:2018-10-26' }
        ```
5. Both the *move* and *drop* operations are performed in a single transaction, so throughout your entire ingestion process and after it, the full data set in `T` remains available for queries.
6. Assuming the tagged data shards that were originally in `T` are no longer of interest, simply drop the `T_temp` table using the [.drop table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/tables#drop-table) command. Or, if you have additional flows utilizing it for the same purpose in parallel - drop the specific [extents (data shards)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview) from it, using the [.drop extents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-commands#drop-extents) command.

> **Important Note:** there could be a downside to over-using extent tagging (e.g. if you tag each ingestion operation with a unique [drop-by](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview#drop-by-extent-tags) tag). Make sure you're familiar with the performance notes in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview#extent-tagging). If you do find you use them excessively, it's recommended you use the [.drop extent tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-commands#drop-extent-tags) command to remove tags which are no longer required.

### Moving extents (data shards) between tables

If, however, you're simply in need of adding new data to your table, without replacing or dropping existing data, but you still want all the new data to become available to queries at once, I would suggest:
1. Ingesting into a "temporary" table (`T_temp`)
2. Using the [.move extents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-commands#move-extents) command, after all ingestions have completed, to move the newly created extents (data shards) from `T_temp` to your target table (`T`).

## Back-filling data

In some cases, you want to ingest historical data into your table(s), however you still want it to be managed according to the policies (e.g. [retention policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/concepts/retentionpolicy), [caching policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/concepts/cachepolicy)) you have defined.

For these cases, the `creationTime` [ingestion property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/data-ingestion/#ingestion-properties) is very useful. Multiple ingestion methods allow you to specify this ingestion property, with the effect of it overriding the [extent's (data shard's)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview) creation time - This is a metadata property of the [extent (data shard)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/extents-overview), according to which both [retention policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/concepts/retentionpolicy) and [caching policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/concepts/cachepolicy) policies are applied.
