# Analyzing 2 Billion New York City Taxi rides in Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)

The [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/index.page){:target="_blank"} makes
historical data about taxi trips and for-hire-vehicle trips (such as [Uber](analyzing-uber-rides-history.md){:target="_blank"},
Lyft, Juno, Via, etc.) [available](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page){:target="_blank"}
for anyone to download and analyze. These records capture pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations,
trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

In a [previous post](ingesting-nyc-taxi-rides.md), I detailed how simple and efficient it is to ingest this data set into **Kusto (Azure Data Explorer)**.

A quick Google search will show you many people took a 1.x Billion taxi rides data set for a ride, for:
* Comparing query performance of multiple data platforms with different topologies.
* Gaining insights from the data about topics like rush hour traffic, popular work hours for investment bankers,
  how [Uber](analyzing-uber-rides-history.md){:target="_blank"}, Lyft and their competitors are changing the landscape for taxis, etc.
    * Here's [an example](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/){:target="_blank"}
      by [Todd W. Schneider](https://github.com/toddwschneider){:target="_blank"}.

In this post, I will do some of both.

## Query Performance

### Setup

For the purpose of this evaluation, I used:

1. An **Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)** cluster with `D14_v2` nodes, which I've scaled gradually from 2 to 4, 6 and finally - 8 nodes.
    * These VMs have 16 vCPUs and 112GB of RAM.
        * I later on scaled down the cluster to 2 `D12_v2` (4 vCPUs, 28GB of RAM) nodes, and repeated the same query test run.
    * I created this cluster using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal){:target="_blank"}
    * In this cluster, I [created a database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal#create-a-database){:target="_blank"}
      named `TaxiRides`.
    * In this database, I created the `Trips` table, and ingested the data into it, as I've detailed in a [previous post](ingesting-nyc-taxi-rides.md).
    * I have applied no tweaks or tricks neither during ingestion nor during queries - this is a fully managed service which takes care of everything for you.
    * The `Trips` table includes **1,547,471,776** records.

        ```
        Trips
        | count
        ```
    
        |Count        |
        |-------------|
        |1,547,471,776|


2. Four basic aggregation queries (detailed [below](#results)).

3. A simple application, written using
[Kusto's .NET client library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/api/netfx/about-kusto-data){:target="_blank"},
in which I replayed these queries over and over again, so that I can look at the percentiles of the query execution times.
    - Needless to say, that C# is just one of the languages in which the 
      [client libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/api/){:target="_blank"} are available.

### Cost

If you're interested in the cost per hour for the different cluster sizes, check out the pricing details using the
[Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/){:target="_blank"}.

### Results

**Note:** If you're comparing these to other runs available online, make sure you're doing apples-to-apples comparison,
taking into account the size of the data set, the resources, and their cost.

I used [.show queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/queries){:target="_blank"} to capture, per query:
* The number of executions.
* The minimum execution time.
* The 50th and 95th percentiles of the execution time.

I repeated this for each of the 4 cluster sizes, and these are the results:

*I'd say that's pretty fast, huh?*

## Exploring and Analyzing the data

*Still at it. This is quite the fun experience* ðŸ˜€ *Stay tuned ...*
